## About the Game

Welcome to "Santa's (Lilly's) Christmas Cookies" - an adventurous and humorous Christmas-themed game where you play as Lilly, a fun-loving dog at the North Pole. Santa has lost his Christmas cookies and needs Lilly's help to find them. However, there's a twist! Instead of returning them, Lilly ends up eating the cookies, adding a funny and unexpected element to the game.
